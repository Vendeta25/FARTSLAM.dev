    <p>There are plenty of places you could go to see the most specific baseball stats you can think of. % of swings against curevballs that made contact? Yup. Number of steals vs. 
    left handed pitchers? Someone has it. VORP? I swear it's real. But off the top of my head, I couldn't think of a single place to see any data GRAPHED. Well, that's what this is. Enjoy.</p>

    <p>The whole site is a pretty basic MVC structure, using Chart.js for the graphing and bootstrap for style. Credit to https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/ and MLB Advanced Media, L.P ("MLBAM") 
    for the API and data. This is for completely non-comercial use. There will never be any money made using this site by me.</p>
